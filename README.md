## Why dtree?

**dtree** combines the simplicity of `tree` with the power of modern file managers, creating the perfect tool for developers who live in the terminal. Unlike traditional file managers that try to do everything, dtree focuses on what matters most: **fast navigation** and **intelligent file viewing**.

**Navigate instantly.** Jump between projects with bookmarks, find files with fuzzy search, and preview code with syntax highlighting - all without leaving your keyboard. No more endless `cd` commands or opening heavy GUIs just to peek at a file.

**Stay in flow.** Built with Rust for blazing-fast performance and zero-copy operations, dtree handles massive directory trees without breaking a sweat. Asynchronous search runs in the background while you keep working. Your terminal, your speed.

**Your tool, your way.** Fully customizable themes, configurable keybindings, and seamless shell integration. Works beautifully with vim-style navigation, integrates with your favorite editor, and fits naturally into your existing workflow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/holgertkey/dtree.git
cd dtree
cargo build --release
cp target/release/dtree ~/bin/

# Launch from current directory
dt

# Navigate to a directory
dt /path/to/directory

# View a file in fullscreen
dt -v README.md

# Create and use bookmarks
dt                    # Open dtree
# Press 'm' to create bookmark
# Press 'q' to exit
dt myproject          # Jump to bookmark instantly

# Basic navigation inside dtree:
# j/k - move up/down
# l/h - expand/collapse
# s - toggle file preview
# / - search
# i - help
```

---

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/holgertkey/dtree.git
cd dtree
cargo build --release

# Install to user bin
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp target/release/dtree ~/bin/

# Or install system-wide
sudo cp target/release/dtree /usr/local/bin/
```

### Bash Integration (Recommended)

Add this to your `~/.bashrc` for seamless shell integration:

```bash
# Directory tree navigator
dt() {
  # Store current directory before navigation
  local prev_dir="$PWD"

  # Handle special case: dt - (return to previous directory)
  if [ "$1" = "-" ]; then
    if [ -n "$DTREE_PREV_DIR" ] && [ -d "$DTREE_PREV_DIR" ]; then
      cd "$DTREE_PREV_DIR" || return
      export DTREE_PREV_DIR="$prev_dir"
    else
      echo "dt: no previous directory" >&2
      return 1
    fi
    return
  fi

  # If flags or bookmark commands are passed, run dtree directly
  case "$1" in
    -h|--help|--version)
      command dtree "$@"
      return
      ;;
    -bm)
      # Bookmark management - run directly
      command dtree "$@"
      return
      ;;
  esac

  # For navigation: dtree resolves paths/bookmarks
  local result=$(command dtree "$@")
  local exit_code=$?

  if [ $exit_code -ne 0 ]; then
    return $exit_code
  fi

  # Only cd if result is a valid directory
  if [ -n "$result" ] && [ -d "$result" ]; then
    cd "$result" || return
    # Save previous directory for dt -
    export DTREE_PREV_DIR="$prev_dir"
  fi
}
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## CLI Commands

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Launch interactive tree from current directory
dt

# Navigate to specific directory
dt /path/to/directory

# Jump to bookmark
dt myproject

# Return to previous directory (like cd -)
dt -
```

### File Viewing

```bash
# View file in fullscreen mode
dt -v README.md
dtree --view README.md

# After viewing, press 'q' to navigate to file's directory
```

### Bookmark Management

```bash
# List all bookmarks
dt -bm
dt -bm list

# Add bookmark for current directory
dt -bm add myproject

# Add bookmark for specific path
dt -bm add myproject /path/to/directory

# Remove bookmark
dt -bm remove myproject
```

### Help and Version

```bash
# Show help
dtree -h
dtree --help

# Show version
dtree --version
```

### Navigation Priority

When you run `dt <name>`, dtree resolves in this order:
1. **Bookmark** - If bookmark exists, jump to it
2. **Path** - If valid path, navigate to it
3. **Error** - Show error message

dt                    # Open tree navigator
dt /path              # Navigate to directory
dt myproject          # Jump to bookmark

## Requirements

### Build Requirements

- **Rust 1.70+** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

### Optional Dependencies

- **Nerd Fonts** - For file type icons (enable with `show_icons = true`)
- **hexyl** - For binary file viewing (`cargo install hexyl`)
- **xclip** - For clipboard support on Linux (usually pre-installed)

---

## Performance

dtree is designed for speed:

- **Zero-copy tree operations** - Uses `Rc<RefCell<>>` to avoid cloning
- **Lazy loading** - Directories loaded only when expanded
- **Async operations** - Search and size calculations run in background
- **Efficient rendering** - Only visible nodes are processed

Typical performance:
- **Tree navigation**: Instant (< 1ms)
- **Search**: ~100,000 files/second
- **File preview**: Loads up to 10,000 lines instantly

---

## Architecture

dtree has a modular architecture with separated concerns:

```
main.rs          Entry point, CLI, terminal setup
app.rs           State manager (orchestrator)
navigation.rs    Tree navigation logic
file_viewer.rs   File content display
search.rs        Search functionality
ui.rs            Rendering logic
event_handler.rs Input processing
config.rs        Configuration management
bookmarks.rs     Bookmark management
```

See [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for details.
